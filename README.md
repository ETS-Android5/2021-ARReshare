# AR Reshare App

### An application that allows people to share the goods, gifts and food they no longer need or want.

The app allows a contributor to list an item they would like to share/offer for free along with their postcode. A consumer can either search for an item or they can view their local area via an AR map view. The consumer can then send a request for an item via the tool, get in touch with the contributor and arrange a pickup.
